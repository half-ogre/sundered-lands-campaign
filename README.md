# The Sundered Lands Campaign
_This repo contains campaign resources for a homebrew D&D campaign called **The Sundered Lands**. A campaign introduction and list of campaign resources are provided below._

## Campaign Introduction
In the beginning, the worlds were one. The spirits of people, animals, and plants lived harmoniously entwined as individual beings called Folk. The Folk shared this world with the Great Spirits, who gave from their endless energy and essence to make and maintain the lands, seas, and skies.

The Folk and the Great Spirits lived together in partnership for countless ages, building a vast civilization that spanned the world’s surface. Times were good until the twin Great Spirits of Light and Dark decided they could no longer exist in balance. 

From the beginning, Light waxed while Dark waned and Light waned while Dark waxed. The cycles of day and night, of life and death, of creation and entropy, and of order and chaos all were tied to the balance between the twin Great Spirits. They were content so being until they learned their essence could be channeled, manipulated, and cast as Magic. How they learned this remains unknown.

A civil war ensued as Light and Dark used Magic to try to change the balance between them. They taught the Folk that followed them how to channel their own essence, and that of the world, to cast Magic. The war was furious and fast. It ended when Light and Dark cast powerful Magic to sunder their connection to be free of their bond and balance. 

The Great Sundering had unexpected consequences. 

Light and Dark were separated at the cost of the world and all the Folks that followed them being separated as well. The Great Sundering created a new, parallel world that came to be called The Sundered Lands. All the Folk that followed Light and Dark were cast into this new world, but their entwined spirits were sundered into separate people, animals, and plants. The Folk that had remained neutral in the war remained in their own world (now called the Folk Lands), but alone. The Great Spirits disappeared. Even Light and Dark were nowhere to be found.

The people of the Sundered Lands found ways to survive and then thrive in their new world without Folk and Great Spirits. The people built towns and then nations. They learned to cast Magic by channeling the essence of the Folklands through a connection they still don’t understand. After scores of generations, all memory of Folk and Great Spirits faded away. 

The animals and plants retreated to places far away from the people. The once deep connection between humans and the animals and plants was replaced by fear and aggression. People destroyed the animals and plants and consumed them. Animals and plants learned to fight back.

In the Folklands, the remaining Folk carried on without their Great Spirit patrons. Things seemed to be fine, but there was a slow decline across the generations that was only barely noticed. The lands, seas, and skies started to decline. The cities started to crumble. Some Folk began to fade.

The Folks’ Magic proficiency grew throughout this time. After scores of generations where all efforts to reverse The Fading failed, a group of the most powerful Farsight Mages gathered to prophesy what could be done. After a year and a day of starved meditation and channeling the essence of the Folklands, they came to a shared vision: the Great Spirits still existed but were trapped in the Sundered Lands. Their energy and essence was needed to restore the Folklands.

## The Adventure Begins
The great Farsight Mages (now called the Blind Mages after the Great Vision took their eyesight) summoned all Folks in the Folklands to gather in Last City so they could choose small groups of would-be heroes to cross into the Sundered Lands to find and free each of the Great Spirits. The Magic required to cross into the Sundered Lands had been discovered a few generations before, but no one yet had discovered how to cross back. Many have crossed over but none have returned.

No one understands how the Blind Mages chose their heroes. Thousands of candidates were brought before them. The mages cast their dull, still eyes on each in turn, occasionally selecting one here and there for reasons known only to them. After all heroes had been selected, the Blind Mages made them into groups, again for reasons only they understand.

Now the day of the Great Sending has arrived. You and your group’s fellow heroes, and other groups of heroes as well, have gathered in the middle of intricate Magic patterns, waiting to depart. The Blind Mages begin the intricate motions and incantations that channel, shape, and cast the Magic that will send you across into the other world.

The patterns begin to glow and to send sparks of Magic that burn no less than fire would, though they leave no marks. You begin to shake, or to vibrate really. You reach out to hold on to one another, to broaden your stance, and to keep your bearing as you begin to feel the ground move beneath you. The vibration grows to be more than you can bear. As much as you try to remain conscious, you feel your body failing and falling just as everything fades to black.



You wake in a different world, on a field of grass amidst a canopy of trees. The colors, shapes, textures, and everything around you is somehow both similar and strangely different. You see your fellow heroes also coming to, and starting to stand. What you see nearly sends you into shock: all your companions look completely different!

Yet, you recognize each of them. It is as if their animal spirit has un-entwined and left only the person spirit. You feel it in yourself, too. You can feel that your animal spirit is still there, but it is somehow weaker and more distant. You can feel that you, too, look like the others, as a mere person without your animal facets. It is a deeply disconcerting feeling.

You all take the day to adjust to these changes. You test your connection to the Folklands, confirming that you can still channel your essences and cast your Magic. You talk through your fears and anxiety. You make a plan to depart the next morning, and enjoy your companionship by a foriegn-looking campfire.

Now it is morning. Now you must seek out The Great Tree Spirit. You have only one clue: that it will be trapped in the form of a great and strange tree out of place in this world.

What do you do?
