## Features & Traits
- _**Amphibious (in Folklands).**_ You can breathe air and water.
- _**Regeneration (in Folklands).**_ You regain 2 hit points at the start of your turn. If you take acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the your next turn. You die only if you starts your turn with 0 hit points and don't regenerate.
- _**Channel Essence (in Sundered Lands).**_ You may channel your essence to use your _Amphibious_ and _Regeneration_ traits for one hour. During this time, you appear as you would in the Folklands with the addition of a faint, radiant light emitting from your body. You may not channel your essence again until you finish a long rest. 
- _**Knight Rank.**_ You were a herald and healer in the military order Knights of the Old Light of rank Knight.
- _**Fighting Style: Protection.**_ When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
- _**Lay on Hands.**_ You can channel the remainder of Light's old essence through your hands to heal wounds.
  - You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your level Ã— 5.
  - As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.
  - Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
  - This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.
