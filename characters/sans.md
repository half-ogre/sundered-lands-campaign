## Features & Traits
- _**Strong Legs (in Folklands).**_ You jump twice the normal distance.
- _**Double Kick (in Folklands).**_  You can "stand" on your tail to deliver a mighty double kick. Your double kick is a melee attack that uses your Strength modifier and profciency bonus. You may deliver your double kick either as an Attack action or as a bonus action. As an Attack action, a successful attack deals 2D6 + Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. As a bonus action, a successful attack deals 1D4 + your Strength  modifier bludgeoning damage. You may use your double kick trait a number of times equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier and this number resets with a long rest.
- _**Channel Essence (in Sundered Lands).**_ You may channel your essence to use your _Strong Legs_ and _Double Kick_ traits for one hour. During this time, you appear as you would in the Folklands with the addition of a faint, radiant light emitting from your body. You may not channel your essence again until you finish a long rest. 
- _**Ear to the Ground.**_ You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.
- _**Sneak Attack.**_ Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
  - You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- _**Second Wind.**_ You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
