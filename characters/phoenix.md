## Features & Traits
- _**Keen Sight.**_ You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- _**Flight (in Folklands).**_ You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.
- _**Talons (in Folklands).**_ Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
- _**Channel Essence (in Sundered Lands).**_ You may channel your essence to use your _Flight_ and _Talons_ traits for one hour. During this time, you appear as you would in the Folklands with the addition of a faint, radiant light emitting from your body. You may not channel your essence again until you finish a long rest.
- _**Wanderer.**_ You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.
- _**Fighting Style: Archery.**_ You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
- _**Natural Explorer.**_ You are particularly familiar with mountainous environments and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to mountainous terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.
  - While traveling for an hour or more in mountains, you gain the following benefits:
    - Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
    - Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
    - Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
    - If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
    - When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
