### In the Folklands
In the Folklands, Axolotl Folk look like a 3' to 4' tall axolotl that stands on two legs and has hands with opposable thumbs. Their legs and arms are larger in ratio to their body than an axolotl, with roughly human proportions. On land their gill stalks are flat to their backs, but in water they fan out. They have a large, paddle-like tail slightly longer than their legs. Axolot Folks' faces are flatter than an axolotl's but they have the same small, widely-spaced eyes and large smiling mouth.
