# Axolotl Folk
The Axolotol Folk are a [Folk](/rules/races/README.md#folk) race of a person spirit harmoniously entwined with an axolotl spirit.

### In the Folklands
In the Folklands, an Axolotl Folk looks like a 3' to 4' tall axolotl that stands on two legs and has hands with opposable thumbs. Their legs and arms are larger in ratio to their body than an axolotl, with roughly human proportions. On land their gill stalks are flat to their backs, but in water they fan out. They have a large, paddle-like tail slightly longer than their legs. Axolot Folks' faces are flatter than an axolotl's but they have the same small, widely-spaced eyes and large smiling mouth.

### In the Sundered Lands
In the Sundered Lands, an Axolotl Folk looks like a short person with a very round face, widely spaced eyes, and a large mouth that always seems to be smiling. They have long, webbed fingers and toes and wild hair that somehow resembles an axolotl's gill stalks.
