# Homebrew Races

## Folk

Folk are the people that inhabit the Folklands. They are beings of animal and person (or plant and person) spirits harmoniously entwined as a single individual. Each Folk race has physically traits of both a person and the animal. For example, a Fox Folk typically has a fox's fur coat, a long snout and fox nose, and a fox tail, but otherwise has a person's body and shape. An Owl Folk has the head of an owl and wings, but human legs, arms, and hands.

Each Folk race a player chooses will have a custom homebrew race defined here.
